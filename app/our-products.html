                    </b> <br/>
                    Geographic information systems (GIS) focus on visualizing, assessing, and drawing conclusions from data. While the technology is still relatively new, the health care sector is already seeing applications of the technology in mapping disease. Learn more about how GIS systems are mapping disease and the difference this technology makes.

                        Mapping techniques date back to the turn of the 19th century, according to Ed Yong of The Scientist. Yong points to the example of John Snow, who mapped cases of cholera in London during 1854. His diagram helped trace the disease’s source back to a water pump. However, as technology has advanced, so has the way we map diseases.

                        While people working on the ground can collect some disease information, technology helps supplement this data, according to Yong. Local health information becomes shared and combined with satellite data. Medical databases, such as PubMed and GenBank, contain geospatial information for a range of diseases. Social networks also provide valuable information. Yong reports that Twitter predicted H1N1 swine flu outbreaks as much as two weeks ahead of traditional surveillance techniques.

                  <b >Applying disease maps</b>  <br/>
                        Every year, parasitic diseases, including malaria, impact hundreds of millions of people who live in developing countries, according to Karen Sprey of Gizmag. These nations don’t have resources to waste; disease mapping helps them target resources to areas in need.

                        The Australian National University is spearheading a project to predict patterns of parasitic diseases in Bhutan, Vanuatu, and other developing nations. Its team combines local health information with satellite data, including temperature, vegetation, and rainfall. This information is uploaded into a GIS, which converts that data into a map identifying areas where parasitic disease outbreaks are likely. Key decision makers can then send preventative resources, such as bed nets and insecticides, where they’ll be helpful.

                        A team of GISCorps volunteers is contributing to the NetHope Ebola Response Project, creating field maps and other visualizations charting the disease in West Africa. Key decision makers and medical field crews use these maps, enabling resources to be appropriately allocated and a clear picture of the epidemic achieved, according to NetHope. While the work is ongoing, Melodie Grubbs, a member of the team and student studying Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST), presented the findings at the 2015 Esri User Conference in San Diego.

                        <b>The future of disease mapping</b>  <br/>
                        Disease mapping tends to be reactive, in response to outbreaks of diseases that include cholera, swine flu, or Ebola. However, Yong reports many scientists believe the future of disease mapping lies in proactive responses to illness, like the Australian National University project.

                        Disease mapping should also expand to provide more detailed data of locations around the world, according to GIS specialist David Pigott. After studying existing disease mapping data, he told The Scientist there is some detailed information collected by researchers working on the field, but we lack comprehensive data on a world scale. “Maps that did cover the world were of lower quality and relied on an expert saying, ‘I know it’s in this country,’” he explains.

                        The impact disease mapping has already made points to the enormous potential this technology holds for the way we manage diseases.
